		World can be best seen through stories great scholars and virtuous men have raised the glory of this country. The land of hills is famous for its alluring stations and blissful environment but these high Himalayas have much more to talk about her brave hearts who stood for their land with high spirits and courage. Tales of patriotism overflowed with loyalty and allegiance that are result of knowledge and belief marked this great land, which is known by many names like <i>Dev Bhoomi, moksha dwara, manas khand, maya puri, santa nagri, yoga nagari</i> etc. Great souls who faced pains, exploitation, immense torture and hardships to bring freedom. The list of freedom fighters is endless. Some of them are known while others quietly sacrificed their life for the protection of their motherland. Here I made a small effort to understand their sacrifice. <b>They are revolutionary who used non-violence as the weapon proving that pen is mightier than the sword.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			They made awareness among the people for their basic rights and power. They inspired and motivated others to fight injustice. All of the freedom fighters donâ€™t fight with arms against the colonizers but they joined protests through literature, legal advocates and so on. It was because of them that the country men united with bond of nationalism and patriotic feelings. They are considered to be the propelling force behind the success of the freedom struggles. They keep the love for their motherland above everything.
