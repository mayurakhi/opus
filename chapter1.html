	<p>It was a chilly January morning. Mountains and plants were busy playing hide and seek under the beautiful white cover of fog. I was busy competing with daju in taking out breath vapour; favourite hobby in chilly winters. Our competition came to a halt when ija called out to me “Chhaya! Come here quickly and help me serve dubke and chai.”</p>
		<p><br>Ija cooks dubke rarely and it is far most my favourite dish. When I served dubke to baba and barbajyu, they didn’t even saw it and kept mumbling about something. All I heard was “Uttarayani Mela” and “Coolie-Begar”. Nothing made sense to me. I know I should not meddle in elder’s business but curiosity got the better of me. </br></p>
		<p><br>I ran to Raghav daju and asked him about “coolie-begar”. He explained, “Chhaya, coolie-begar is a law issued by the British officials. Under this the villagers are compelled to carry the loads of British officials and European travelers and also provide them with milk and vegetables when they are on tour without expecting to getting paid for the work they have done. The British had inherited from native maharajas a system of forced labour known as begar, which they imposed on the peasantry.” I burning with anger replied, “This is so unfair and exploitation of our people.” Daju in unison with me continued, “That is why Badri Dutt Pandey ji keeps writing about the exploitation of our people in the Almora Akhbar and has also decided to start a non-cooperation movement against it.” Admiring his courage, I started a volley of question about asking about his work and plans from daju. Daju told me that Badri Dutt Pandey was the editor of Almora Akhbar, a vernacular newspaper, he constantly wrote about the atrocious laws of the British government. Daju, unfortunately didn’t know a lot neither about the developments in the movement nor about elders conversation.</br></p>
		<p><br>Continuing my inquiry, I asked baba about the upcoming movement but he said to not meddle in these things. I know that everyone must be knowing about this movement but nobody wants to share it with me because I am 9 years old.
			The same day I heard Neetu bodi and Soni chchi chattering about coolie begar but I also heard them using words like ‘coolie uttar’ and ‘coolie burdayash’. Hearing these words, I rushed to daju and asked him whether ‘coolie begar’, ‘coolie uttar’ and ‘coolie burdayash’ same. He responded, “you can say that, they have a very small difference. Coolie begar means forced labour without payment. Coolie uttar carries an obligation of minimum wage payment although often it is taken without payment while coolie burdayash refers to extraction of produce for officials, soldiers, tourists and their animals. But these three hardly get paid.” This is so unfair; I am glad that Badri ji is doing something about it.
			</br></p>
		<p><br>Uttarayani was around the corner and ija was busy preparing sweets in the kitchen. Atmosphere was filled with the fragrance of bal mithai, arsa and jhangori kheer. But this time apart from the preparations of fair and festival something else was going on in Bageshwar.
			Everyone was talking about coolie-begar movement and Uttarayani fair. From what I gathered was there was some connection between the fair and the unfair law.
			Nishad chcha was always friendly to me and shared mostly everything with me. With the hope of getting information regarding the talks of the villagers I went to his room. Chcha in a very low voice almost whispering told me, “Chhaya this time the Uttarayani fair will be place of a peaceful protest against the coolie-begar law. This movement will be under the leadership of Badri Dutt Pandey Sahib.” I was flabbergasted. A sense of pride ignited in me.
			I said to chcha, “Badri ji is such a great person.” My eyes shone with pride.
			The over morrow was the Uttarayani fair and the beginning of Coolie-begar movement. I for one was very excited.
			In the living room Soni chchi turned on the radio to listen the latest news. The speaker said, “A notice has been issued to Badri Dutt Pandey stating that no protests or movement should be commenced in the Uttarayani fair.”
			I was raging with fire but baba and Nishad chcha was as calm as water and continued sipping the chai. On asking them that aren’t they angry on listening to this news they replied, “It will have no effect on Badri Sahib or the movement, he is a strong-minded person.”
			</br></p>
		<p><br>Finally, Uttarayani festival arrived and we all went to the Uttarayani fair although the children were taken there, they were not allowed to go out of the Bagnath temple.</br></p>
		<p><br>There the women and the men and Badri ji went to the holy Bagnath temple to receive the blessing of the god before starting the movement against the cruel and unfair law issued by British Government. There was calmness and defeaning silence. This was a silence before the anger of the people gets out. After the prayer everyone started to move towars the confluence of sarayu and gomati.</br></p>
		<p><br>There Badri ji gave a very powerful and a motivational speech. Its crux was, us the people will not tolerate the exploitation and unfair practice done by the British to the people of the hills. Everyone’s heart was thumping and pumping vigorously.</br></p>
		<p><br>We could hear the screams of the injustice done, the gushing of the riven sarayu as if sarayu nadi was agreeing with each and everyword of its people. I could also sense the anger of the nadi. </br></p>
		<p><br>Then badri dutt pandey ji threw the register of coolie-begar into the river sarayu. Then folded his hand in front of the riven to naman the Sarayu nadi. He instructed everyone in the movement to take the holy water in their hand and present an oath:-</br></p>
		<p><br><i>“Taking the water of the sacred sarayu and with bagnath temple as a witness we pledge that we will not tolerate ‘coolie-begar’, ‘coolie-uttar’ and ‘coolie-burdayash’ anymore.”</i></br></p>
	<p><br><b>On 14th January 1921, people from different villages gathering a crowd of nearly 40 thousand moved to the confluence of sarayu and gomati raising flags and banner with ‘END COOLIE-BEGAR’ inscribed on them under the leadership of BADRI DUTT PANDEY. </b></br></p>
	<p><br><b>Later Mahatama Gandhi offered effusive praise for the movement saying, “It’s effect was complete, it was a bloodless revolution.”</b></br></p>
	<p><br><b>For the success of the movement Badri Dutt Pandey came to be known as ‘KUMAUN KESARI’- the lion of Kumaun.</b></br></p>
