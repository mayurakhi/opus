	<p>The coolie begar movement just ended and successfully it completed its aim. Everyone in the mountains so much happy. There was relief and happiness and a sense of pride. Everyone was expressing happiness in various ways. And the utmost thing to rejoice was that this movement came into action because we all were united. All for one, one for all.</p>
	<p><br>Nothing can be more thrilling than seeing common people movement from conception to execution and witnessing and witnessing its success.
		Dear readers I am talking about how the spark of revolt from Almora Akhbar changes into a wild fire across kumaun as a result the British government was forced to abolish coolie begar.
		</br></p>
	<p><br>This incident induced a fresh wave of patriotism and jingoism to extent on mine and daju’s deep rooted feeling of nationalism.</br></p>
	<p><br>Earlier our day started with chai and kafuli and then simple talks which go on and on, it is never ending, but now the days starts with reading newspaper and talking about national movements that are taking place not only in Uttarakhand but throughout the country.</br></p>
	<p><br>Our lives start revolving more around local newspaper and then discussing or comprehending with insights of daju. This behavior changes  of ours is well observed and noted by ija. She called us both, “Chhaya! Raghav! Come fast there is some work I wanted to give you both. Come fast.” Upon reaching there she kept staring at Daju. She said, “Chhaya go to the garden and give water to the plant they are dying. And you Raghav stay here, we need to talk.” I went out of the room but hid behind the curtains. I was scared that daju was asked to stay there because Ija was going to scold him. But to my surprise she warned Daju that don’t involve too much into these issues that are related to national movements and politics of these as they have to be handled with much responsibility and maturity. According to her daju is just an eighteen years old boy too naïve and nascent for these sensitive issues. To her protective and motherly response Daju replied in his total flag-waving attitude, “No Ija, thinking like this is not right, country need her youth more than ever. Barrister Mukundi Lal in his newspaper Tarun Kumaun from Lansdowne made an appeal for regional youth and students to become involved in political life and national concerns.” Daju quoted him that, “the aim of a student is to acquire education  and increase knowledge of politics, to see what is the political  situations in our country is the duty of each and every student, we believe politics to be a life of scienc of human society. To make such a rule that students should remain separate from political movements would be a national suicide.” The argument went on and on but in the end Ija got tired of it.</br></p>
	<p><br>Listening all this conversation from behind the curtains. My senses got tinkled off with a new name Mukundi Lal ji, getting more and more eager to know about him. Once Ija left for the kitchen to make aloo ke gutke for lunch. I hurriedly jumped to daju and asked excitedly him about Mukundi Lal ji. First daju was little apprehend as he doesn’t want another spat with Ija but with lots of coaxing. He finally got ready to settle my quizzical appetite.</br></p>
	<p><br>“Listen Chhaya, Mukundi Lal ji is from Chamoli, Patali Village getting his early education from pauri and almora he has done his later education from Allahabad, Calcutta and seeing his devotion and extraordinary skills Shri Ghanananad Khanduri has sponsored his education at Oxford. He is a very learned man. Besides being a prolific writer ad journalist. He is a skilled photographer, art lover and having keen interest for wild flora and fauna. After attending many conferences and meeting with national freedom fighters he formed congress in Uttarakhand. He enrolled about 800 meters and actively participated in the coolie begar movement. He knows the pulse of hills.”
		Our conversation for the time being because I had to complete the chores given to me by Ija. But my curiosity continued for the rest of the afternoon.
		</br></p>
	<p><br>In the evening I couldn’t hold my curiosity anymore it was going to burst any moment and it should burst only in front of daju or else Ija will burst out with anger at me. I rushed to Daju’s bedroom to ask more about Mukundi Lal ji.
		Avidly and keenly Daju looked into my eyes and said what barrister Mukundi Lalji has done to save hero Peshawar-platoon commander Chandra Singh and his soldiers from death penalty. I was having an awestruck feeling.
		Curiosly I asked daju to explain in detail please he answered patiently that, “on April 13,1930 thousand of people had gathered at kissa khani market in front of the polic station in Peshawar in protest of the British rule and demand for independence. On this the British captain ordered the garhwal rifles to open fire at the crowd as soon as the order was shouted much to the surprise veer Chandra Singh loudly ordered the troupe to cease fire on questioning by the superiors, he said that he won’t be firing at innocent unarmed people. Mukundi Lal ji went to Abetabad to fight the case of thirty-nine garhwal rifles known for his intelligent litigation he made strong points before judge in support of actions taken by soldiers consequently judge is convinced y barrister Mukundi Lal ji’s oral argument. And hence they were barred from death penalty.”
		</br></p>
	<p><br>I was having an overwhelming experience listening to daju about Mukundi Lal ji. I wanted to know more about him. Daju refused to tell me more because he was sleepy and wanted to go to bed early. Then I thought of getting my weapon out. I told him, “Daju if you don’t tell me more than I will tell not only Ija but also Baba that u have been filling up my mind with all national movements. The ball is in your court.” Daju replied with an angry face, “Okay I will tell you.” See sometimes threatening works.
		Daju started, “Mola Ram, a scholar worked for the development of art and literature during the period of the Gorkha rule and the British rule over garhwal. He wrote the historical wonk Garhrajvansh ka itihas, which is the only source of information about several Garhwal rulers. And you should be proud that Mukundi Lal ji did a lot of research about this and he was the one who bought Mola rams work in literary field to the people. And trust me, gathering its evidences, works and getting the true information was not easy.”
		</br></p>
	<p><br>Mukundi Lal ji is such a great person. I am so grateful that I am living when he is alive. From now onwards I will follow his work. It is great to follow such a great personality.</br></p>
