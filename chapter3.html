	<p>“Swaraj” Oh! I love this word. It always ignites fire of freedom, and a dream of having respect not for me but for the soil of my country, Hindustan. Oh! Sorry I forgot to introduce myself. <i>Myar naam Mohin Joshi cha</i> (my name is Mohan Joshi), firstly the son of my dharti ma and then a patriot who is very much eager to see his dharti ma free of these firangis chains. My ma has seen enough injustice with her and her children. The firangis has insulted it enough and we her children should rise and protect her and her dignity no matter the cost. And today my brother and sisters I am going to share my story of fighting with firangis for independence with you all.</p>
	<p><br>Let’s just say that my story started on January 1, 1896 in Almora in a humble house under the roof of Jaydutt Joshi my father. My father converted to Christianity due to which he named me   Victor Joseph but my   Ija (mother) attachment to Hinduism my name to came to existence as Victor Mohan Joshi. </br></p>
	<p><br>My love for my country naturally come to me maybe because I have seen my father participating in many movements and may be because in my family everyone was a true patriot. Thus, whenever I got the opportunity to do something for my country, I never gave it a second thought I just took that opportunity. After all I was an opportunist. This all began in my school life only. To do something good no time is early after all. Independence can’t be gained in just a day. I had to get started from somewhere and that somewhere was my school.</br></p>
	<p><br>In my school days my teachers had an image of me as a brilliant student of sharp intellect. Not bragging at all. I was a decent and intelligent student. 
		I received my early education from Ramje School.
		</br></p>
	<p><br>While studying in school only, I noticed that the Christian students studying there were not united at all. How did I got to know it? Well firstly whenever a Christian student was in trouble no one came to his aid, moreover the students who were Christian did not like getting involved in speeches or plays that were dedicated to our country. it may look a small issue, easy to be neglected but if you look at it in a bigger picture you will notice that if they are not united it may affect our country’s independence movements. Less participation will mean less pressure on the British government. With this thought in my mind I started to think of ways in which we can get united. Then an idea struck to me, it was by organizing a group or committee of Christians. I established an organization called “Christian Friends Association” in Almora to discuss intellectual development. Later this club become to be known as Christian Young People Society. This club introduced organizational ability in me which proved to be very useful in the coming future.</br></p>
	<p><br>Nevertheless, moving on, I did B.A. in 1917 from Irwin Christian College, Allahabad. And after finishing my studies, my father advised me for a job. I still remember it, crystal clearly. Father used to give me numerous benefits and merits of having a job. But I did not find it way very enlightening. It as rather easy to turn father’s job offer, down. My aim was direct, straight; I wanted to contribute my ability and studies to the country’s independence movement. I wanted that my contribution should be towards the society and country.</br></p>
	<p><br>I was always irritated by foreign works like Victor. Therefore, before participating in the freedom struggle, I stopped using foreign words associated with my name and declared my name as Mohan Joshi. In this way I indigenized my name.</br></p>
	<p><br>I resolved to join the “Swaraj Movement”. For this I decided to wake the Christian Society / Influence by a weekly of national ideas “Swarjya” started bringing out an English weekly name “Christian Nationalist”.</br></p>
	<p><br>In fact, the aim of Christian Nationalist” was to connect Indian Christians with Swarjya movement. This was filled with national sentiments. The Christian society, through this newspaper, was reminded that Jesus was for the fight of freedom. of Jesus, had been crucified. His followers should not remain slaves and should join the fight for freedom. This news paper gave so much strength to the Christian society in Almora that they asked the church to remove the “union Jack”
		Unfortunately, Christian Nationalist did not last long but surely, it ignited fire of independence in Christians which improved the number of people participating in national movements.
		</br></p>
	<p><br>Then I met Badri Dutt Pandey ji who was doing an amazing job. He was fighting again the unfair law, ‘Collie-Begar’. He is an amazing writer, speaker and a true patriot. He followed the path of ahimsa. There was something about him which pulled me towards him almost like a magnet. I also joined him against the fight of coolie-begar law. Many aggressive articles, editorials and paintings were published in his newspaper ‘Almora Akhbar’. This helped us to reach the common people and to instigate them to join us in the movement. And successfully the movement started in the Uttarayani Fair. No violence was there. And its aim was completed. It was the win of righteousness against the evil.</br></p>
	<p><br>A newspaper “Shakti” was introduced by Badri Dutt Pandey, a newspaper dedicated to the country as the editor of “Shakti”. I wrote articles full of love for the country, which directly hurt the British. I was arrested on January 1, 1922, can you see the irony here, my birthday was celebrated in such a splendid way. I had to undergo imprisonment for eleven days. This was not the first time or last time that I got arrested.</br></p>
	<p><br>After the Coolie-begar movement the British was scared of the movements held in the fair thus they started keeping eye on every fair or festival being held with huge gatherings. Section 144 came into action. And because of these huge arrests were being held. In 1923, on the occasion of Shivratri festival, I went to Bhikiyasain. Despite the imposition of Section 144, I delivered proactive speeches related to Swaraj Movement. I was arrested but my well wishers stopped me from going to jail by paying the fine.
		Threats and arrests did not stop me from writing about the country and in against of British Rule. For me, threats and arrests had now become a weekly dose. Once in a while I took special intervention in Hindi and English and also used to give lectures in Kumauni. There I faced questions like that being a Christian can I be a true Indian. And I answered it with a simple line “I am a Christian by name, have close love for Hinduism, I am a child of India”.
		</br></p>
	<p><br>I was always inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s Ideology. So, when he come to Almora I was on cloud nine. I took him to Bagheshwar where the foundation stone of “Swarjya Mandir” was laid by Gandhi. This mandir was another step towards independence. This temple was like a sign to remind people at each and every step that success is near, believe in God and in yourself. </br></p>
	<p><br>To give impetus to the freedom struggle, I published Swadhin Praja” from Almora on January 1. Don’t you think it is funny that everything important is happening on my birthday. Due to this no body remember my birthday. Nevertheless, in this newspaper, writing cam naturally to me. It flowed like the holy Ganges of freedom. Every word I write was covered with love for my country in which anger was reflected. painted with red color of blood of the martyred. While stating the purpose of its publication in the advertisement in of the swadhin praja newspaper, I said, “Swadhin Praja will publish true and correct news, organize the people for making the country independent and for the national awakening will propagate the principles of the independence in villages as well as in the cities and towns. In place of colonial self-government, independent subjects supported complete independence. Subjects believe that any system depends on the honesty of its operator. This newspaper will be the newspaper of those independent subjects. This newspaper will make the British tremble on the knees.
		There was aggressive journalism for the Swaraj Movement in “swadhin Praja” it was known from its writings that was how a patriot would write. When Bhagat Singh was hanged, the Swadhin Praja criticized the government as hooliganism. A fiery editorial titled Revolution was published in the newspaper. Only eighteen issue it had come out now that a bail six thousand rupees was sought from the letter. This was because of the fierce editorial published that criticized the government a lot. The Swadhin Praja was so intense that such high bail was not asked from any news paper of the country. As a result, the newspaper was closed. Not because of the bail but because of the newspaper and writers’ dignity. 
		</br></p>
	<p><br>But here comes the twist, in October 1930 Swadhin Praja was republished under the editing of Krishanand Shastri. In his editing also the newspaper continued to spread awareness in the mountainous region and continued to work to connect the local population with the national struggle more and more. Alas! Good things do not last for long. In 1932 the swadhin praja was closed. This was because Krishanand Shastri was arrested for publishing articles and editorials against the government. He was released soon but Swadhin Praja was an old chapter now but during its short publication period, it achieved place in the mountain journalism world. Following the path of writing type of Swadhin Praja many more newspaper rose and this time with fiercer and anger and agitation filled articles and editorials.</br></p>
	<p><br>But do you think, the British could sigh with relief with doing just so little. Once again, the jail welcomed me, meaning I was arrested, this time in Bagheshwar sentenced to six months jail and also paying a fine of one hundred rupees. Could this be any worse? Well typically yes, I was ill at that time. But now it just has been one week after I have released from my six-month jail punishment. One thing I got inscribed in my brain after all arrests that threats was that British was scared of my and other writes writings. From them It was like silent voice roaming with anger and each word come from the depths of the heart. Always remember, they cannot silence our writings. So, keep writing and keep moving hearts.</br></p>
	<p><br><i>Jai Hind.</i></br></p>
	<p><br><b>Mohan Joshi has been a name in the freedom struggle of Kumaun, which has made a special place not only as a fighter, but also as a successful editor. Mohan Joshi was such a successful fighter whose intellectuals were also convinced of his scholarship. There was a quality of cowardice and inertia in his speeches. When he gave Vyravyan, he would have made the holy Ganges of Swarajya flow. His writings would ignite in the newspaper and create life in the dead hearts, such a soulful writing style is rare in Hindi journalism even today.</b></br></p>
	<p><br><b>Mohan Joshi's example of patriotism is found only by changing his name. His real name was 'Victor Joseph Joshi'. Born in a Christian family, Mohan Joshi was irritated by foreign words. His mother affectionately called him Mohan. Even before participating in the freedom struggle, he stopped using foreign words associated with his name and declared his name as Mohan Joshi. In this way, Mohan Joshi set a new example by 'indigenizing' his name.</b></br></p>
	<p><br><b>Mohan Joshi had already identified himself as a fierce patriot in Almora before getting higher education in Allahabad. It was at this time that Badridutt Pandey started representing the eternal voices of Swaraj through the Almora newspaper.
		Mohan Joshi’s contribution to the independence was in form of writing which helped a lot in criticizing the British Government and moreover helped in reaching information to the country’s people. This increased contribution of common people too.
