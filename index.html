					<p>
						Mohan Joshi has been a name in the freedom struggle of Kumaun, which has made a special place not only as a fighter, but also as a successful editor. Mohan Joshi was such a successful fighter whose intellectuals were also convinced of his scholarship. There was a quality of cowardice and inertia in his speeches. When he gave Vyravyan, he would have made the holy Ganges of Swarajya flow. His writings would ignite in the newspaper and create life in the dead hearts, such a soulful writing style is rare in Hindi journalism even today.
